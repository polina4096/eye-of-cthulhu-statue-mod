<img src="logo.png" align="right">

Have you ever had a situation where you just wanted to test how powerful you really are? If so, this is your perfect chance!

This mod provides you with a way to craft a statue of the Eye of Cthulhu. When activated, it will spawn the Eye of Cthulhu. As with other statues that spawn NPCs, it's limited to 3 eyes in immediate vicinity, 6 nearby and 10 in the world at a time. Bosses created with the statue do not drop any money and only have a 2% chance of dropping loot.

## Crafting
The statue can be crafted on the [Demon/Crimson Altar](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Altars) with [50 Stone Blocks](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Stone_Block) and a [Suspicious Looking Eye](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Suspicious_Looking_Eye).
